            <h3>Music and Reading</h3>
            <p> I have a passion for both music and non-fiction literature, particularly in 
                the realms of physics and anthropology. My curiosity knows no bounds, and 
                anthropology appeals to my interest in the world's history, including 
                my fascination with dinosaurs and fossils.</p>
            <p>For a tranquil study atmosphere, I turn to classical music and find solace in piano covers of anime soundtracks. 
                When the mood for non-fiction takes a backseat, I immerse myself in the captivating worlds of manga and light novels, 
                allowing my imagination to run wild. As for my favorite dinosaur, it's hard to pick just one, but the vicious Pterodactyl 
                has always held a special place in my heart. Feel free to share your favorite dinosaur too!</p>

        <div class="home-content2">
            <h2>Indeed, the pterodactyl is a fascinating creature from the Mesozoic Era, 
                but you're absolutely right—they aren't dinosaurs!
                It's an excellent choice for a favorite prehistoric creature though</h2>
